\section*{Exercise 1}
There are 4! permutations of ordering the books but just 2 ways of ordering them in ascending and descending order so 


\[P = \frac{2}{4!} = \frac{2}{24} = \frac{1}{12} \]

\section*{Exercise 2}
The cube exists of 6 faces. Every face contribute 16 unique cubes which have two colors. so this adds up o \[6*16 = 96\] cubes.

There are 1000 cubes so \[P = 96/1000\]

\[\frac{\binom{k}{l}  \binom{n-k}{m-l}}{\binom{n}{m}} \]
